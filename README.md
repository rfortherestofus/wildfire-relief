# 2020 Oregon Wildfire Relief Fund Visualizations

This repo contains code to build visualizations to help my client, the Ford Family Foundation, as they look to support communities affected by wildfires. They recently partnered with two other foundations in Oregon to start the [Oregon Wildfire Relief and Recovery Fund](https://oregoncf.org/oregon-wildfire-relief-recovery/community-rebuilding-fund/).

The first step for TFFF is to understand the magnitude of the impact of the wildfires. This is where the map I'll be building will come in. I'll use open-source geospatial data and a few of my favorite R packages to build a map that shows the size and impact of the fires.
